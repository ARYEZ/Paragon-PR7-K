    // PR7-E's LIMITER from 0.16.0 (stomp 7), inspired by FabFilter Pro-L 2.
    // Our own design: Pro-L 2's algorithms aren't published, so this follows
    // what its manual says each control does, not how it does it.
    //
    // GAIN drives the sound into a ceiling (OUTPUT) it never passes. Two stages:
    //   - a fast TRANSIENT stage that looks ahead (LOOKAHEAD, 0 to 5 ms): it
    //     sees each peak coming and eases the gain down over the look-ahead
    //     time, so it's at the right level exactly when the peak arrives. It
    //     can't let a peak through: the gain it applies to each sample is at
    //     most what that sample needs (a moving minimum, then a moving average
    //     over the same window). With no look-ahead it acts at once, close to
    //     clipping.
    //   - a slower RELEASE stage that follows the average level: ATTACK is
    //     how soon it sets in, RELEASE how long it holds. It takes some of the
    //     work off the fast stage, which keeps it cleaner.
    // Each has its own stereo LINK (Pro-L 2's two knobs).
    //
    // STYLE changes how the stages work together (see limiter::characterOf).
    // BRICK, SOFT and AUTO are PR7-C's limiter (effects::Limiter), unchanged,
    // for projects and rigs from before: no look-ahead, oversampling or true
    // peak for those.
    //
    // TRUE PEAK keeps the peaks a converter would rebuild between the samples
    // under the ceiling too: it detects them (4x interpolation), and a last
    // short look-ahead stage catches what the limiting itself adds.
    // OVERSAMPLING (2x to 8x) runs the limiting at a higher rate, for less
    // aliasing. Both add delay (reported to the DAW, see getLatencySamples).
    // Then UNITY (hear it at the input's level), DELTA (hear only what's
    // taken away), OUTPUT TRIM and DITHER, last. DC FILTER comes first.
