    // A read head moves through the last few tens of milliseconds of audio
    // at the new speed: faster than it was played to go up, slower to go
    // down. Moving faster, it catches up with the present and has to jump
    // back; moving slower, it falls behind and has to jump forward. Each
    // jump lands where the waveform matches what's playing (by correlation)
    // and cross-fades from the old position, so the joins are in phase and
    // the shifted pitch stays clean rather than warbling.
