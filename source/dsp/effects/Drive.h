    // Footswitch 2: an overdrive, distortion or fuzz pedal, before the amp, in seven models.
    //
    // SCREAMER is modelled on the Ibanez TS808 Tube Screamer's circuit:
    //
    //   x --+--------------------------------------------(+)--> tone --> level
    //       |                                              ^
    //       +--> 720 Hz low cut -> gain -> diode clipping -+
    //
    // Its op-amp only amplifies above about 720 Hz, and its diodes clip just
    // that amplified part, which is added back on top of the clean guitar.
    // So the bass stays clean and tight and the mids get pushed: the famous
    // mid "hump" that makes it the classic boost in front of a driven amp.
    // The diodes clip both halves of the wave alike (odd harmonics), gently,
    // as diodes in an op-amp's feedback loop do. Its tone control works
    // after a fixed treble cut at 723 Hz, from dark to slightly bright.
    //
    // RABID is modelled on the ProCo RAT 2, op-amp and all (see Rabid.h;
    // PR7-G 0.43.0, replacing the original "Classic" overdrive). DRIVE is its
    // DISTORTION; TONE is its FILTER turned around, so up is brighter, as on
    // the other models.
    //
    // Clipping creates new high harmonics. Without oversampling, the ones
    // above half the sample rate fold back down as harsh, unmusical tones
    // (aliasing). The clipping runs at 8x the rate to keep them out.
    //
    // COSMONAUT is modelled on the green Russian Big Muff, stage by stage
    // from its circuit (see Cosmonaut.h; PR7-G 0.41.0, replacing the
    // original "Muff Fuzz"). DRIVE is its SUSTAIN: two clipping stages give
    // the long sustain, a small capacitor lets the bass through less
    // clipped, and the passive tone stack always scoops the mids.
    //
    // SKYLINE is inspired by the Horizon Devices Precision Drive, a modern
    // metal take on the TS808 above (PR7-G 0.42.0). The same circuit, with:
    //
    //   - ATTACK: an 8-way switch choosing the capacitor in the clipping
    //     stage's 4.7k leg (470 nF down to 33 nF, from builders' traces of
    //     the pedal), so the bass reaching the diodes is cut from about 70 Hz
    //     (full, low-mid punch) to about 1 kHz (tight, pick attack). The
    //     TS808's 47 nF is position 7. TONE is its BRIGHT knob.
    //   - GATE: a gate on the pedal's output, listening to the guitar.
    //
    // CHIMERA is modelled on the Klon Centaur, the "transparent" overdrive
    // (see Chimera.h; PR7-G 0.44.0). DRIVE is its GAIN, TONE its TREBLE.
    //
    // ABYSS is modelled on the Boss MT-2 Metal Zone (see Abyss.h; PR7-G
    // 0.45.0). DRIVE is its DIST; its own HIGH, LOW, MIDDLE and MID FREQ
    // replace TONE.
    //
    // HALO is modelled on the germanium two-transistor fuzz of 1966-68, the
    // whole circuit solved as it is (see Halo.h; PR7-G 0.50.0, replacing
    // PR7-G's earlier, generic FACE FUZZ in the same place in the list).
    // DRIVE is its FUZZ; it has no tone control, so TONE isn't used.
